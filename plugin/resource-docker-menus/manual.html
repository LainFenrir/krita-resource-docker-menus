    <h3>Resource and Docker Menu</h3>
    <p>A simple plugin to add main menu entries for dockers and resources.</p>
    <p>Repository: <a href="https://github.com/LainFenrir/krita-resource-dockers-menus" >Github/LainFenrir/krita-resource-dockers-menus</a></p>

    <p>This plugin introduces 2 new menus, resources and dockers as a way to make them more visible and easier to access.
    This plugin doesn't remove the the dockers and resources from the settings menu, nor its the intention of this plugin. So resources and dockers are accessible from both menus.
    </p>

    <h4>Resources</h4>
    Adds actions to open the resouce manager and the resource library that are also located in the settings menu.
    <br>
    <h4>Dockers </h4>
    Adds a menu with docker related actions of showing dockers and showing the docker titles, and also has a list of dockers not contained in a submenu.
